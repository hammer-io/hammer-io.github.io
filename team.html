            Jack Meyer is a senior majoring in Software Engineering at Iowa State University.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout his experiences at Iowa State, Jack has become passionate about the Software Engineering Program's curriculum and helping other students achieve their goals. This has led to his involvement in the Computer Science and Software Engineering Club (CSE), the Software Engineering Student Advisory Council (SE SAC), and the Software Engineering Learning Community (SELC).
        </p>
        <p>
            Last year, Jack had the opportunity to serve as the president of the CSE club. The CSE club's main goal is to provide networking opportunities between students & students, faculty & students, and industry leaders & students.  While president Jack was able to raise the attendance level at club meetings, hosted some of the biggest CSE club events in recent history and started more outreach in the Ames K-12 community by attending STEM nights at Meeker and Sawyer Elementary Schools.
        </p>
        <p>
            This year Jack is serving as the leader of the SE SAC. The SE SAC's focus is to be the bridge between the student body and faculty members. The SE SAC is continuously listening to feedback from students and using this feedback to provide input and help create changes to the curriculum along with getting more resources for students. The SE SAC host a Student Town Hall each semester for students to come and voice their concerns and thoughts about the Software Engineering Program in a safe environment.
        </p>
         <p>
             Last year, Jack served as one of the first SELC Peer Mentors and continues in this role for the academic year.
         </p>
         <p>
             Jack's technical interests includes: Web Development, Software Architecture, Distributed Systems, and DevOps. Over the last two summers, Jack has interned at Telligen in West Des Moines and will be continuing there after graduation!</p>
